	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a computational concept that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. It provides a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm by describing the upper bound of the time required for its execution in the worst-case scenario. Efficient algorithms are those with lower time complexity, meaning they can process large inputs more quickly compared to algorithms with higher time complexity.

		Here two arrays of length N, and variable i are used in the algorithm so, the total space used is N * c + N * c + 1 * c = 2N * c + c, where c is a unit space taken. For many inputs, constant c is insignificant, and it can be said that the <b>Space Complexity</b> is O(N).
There is also auxiliary space, which is different from space complexity. The main difference is where space complexity quantifies the total space used by the algorithm, auxiliary space quantifies the extra space that is used in the algorithm apart from the given input. In the above example, the auxiliary space is the space used by the freq[] array because that is not part of the given input. So total auxiliary space is N * c + c which is O(N) only.
